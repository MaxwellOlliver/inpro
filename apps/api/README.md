## InPro API

API built with NestJS, following Clean Arch + DDD principles.

Some modules may not follow the “Greek god of beauty” standard in terms of code and folder architecture, but as I learn and try new things, newer modules will look much better. This is study material after all.

Once I have finished, I will refactor all modules to follow the same architecture.
